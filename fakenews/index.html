        <p class="uk-article-lead">Fake news has emerged to become significant issues since the Brexit referendum and subsequently the US presidential elections in 2016. There was saying that such misinformation had influenced the outcome of the two vital polls to a certain degree.</p>

        <p>Now “fake news” is not only a word that referring to news which is factually wrong that deliberately misinforms the public, but it’s also a word frequently used by US president Donald Trump to criticise certain media organisations and news reports.</p>

        <p>Thanks to Trump, the usage of the term “fake news” had increased by 365% since 2016, even before he was inaugurated in January this year, according to Collins Dictionary’s lexicographers. As such, “Fake news” was named as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/02/fake-news-is-very-real-word-of-the-year-for-2017"
            target="_blank">the word of the year</a> in 2017.</p>

        <p>The recognition was mostly due to Trump’s hostile relationship with some prominent media organisations, such as New York Times and CNN. He often fires against those media outlets spreading the fake news for reports that he disagrees.</p>

        <p>As a Twitter’s heavy user, Trump frequently trains his gun on those reports via his personal Twitter account, besides publicly criticising the reporters from those news organisations for allegedly producing fake news in press conferences.</p>

        <p>The term has become a trend and a popular hashtag among Twitter users. This report is to analyse how Twitter users engage with #fakenews in a specific timeframe.</p>

        <h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2>

        <p>The sample of Twitter data containing the word “fake news” and “fakenews” hashtag was collected by using Twitter streaming application programming interface (API) script written in Python between 5pm GMT December 9 and 12am GMT December 14, 2017.</p>

        <p>The script was written so that it could distinguish and scrape truncated original tweets, the full text of retweets and quoted tweets (retweets with users’ comment), besides other information, for more precise analysis result.</p>

        <p>The analysis focuses on understanding the peaks of the tweets timeline, popular retweets and quoted tweets, percentage of verified users, identifying bots among top 10 tweeters, sentiments etc.</p>

        <h2><strong>Findings</strong></h2>

        <ol type="1">

          <li class="font_size">Trump’s tweets against certain media organisations had driven the usage of the fakenews hashtag and “fake news” term.</li>

          <li class="font_size">More than 556,000 Twitter users had tweeted over 150 million tweets that carried #fakenews or “fake news” in 103 hours of scrapping.</li>

          <li class="font_size">Of all the tweets, close to three-quarters of the tweets were retweets. 8.6% were quoted tweets, which were retweets with original text or opinion of the users, while the remaining 16.52% were original tweets.</li>

          <li class="font_size">Lower than 10% of the users who tweeted in the range of the scrapping period were verified users.</li>

          <li class="font_size">Less than half of the top ten most active tweeters were genuine users, whom among others were using web services for retweet purpose.</li>

          <li class="font_size">More than 550,000 users tweeted less than 50 tweets, while two users tweeted more than 400 times during the time span.</li>

              <p class="uk-article-lead">The fakenews hashtag was trending hot on Twitter and had drastically increased several times during the observation period. 556,007 users had tweeted 1,548,139 tweets that carried #fakenews or “fakenews”. The amount only represents approximately
                40% of the total tweets due to the limitation of the streaming API.</p>

              <p>They were all driven by Trump’s tweet against a journalist and some media organisations.</p>

              <p>It reached the peak of 35,855 tweets on 9 December at 2300 UTC, after Trump hit out against Washington Post journalist Dave Weigel over a controversial tweet.</p>

              <p>It started with Weigel posted a picture of Trump’s rally in an arena with many empty seats on Twitter. However, he deleted the post after realising that the venue had not yet filled up.</p>

              <p>It had prompted Trump to tweet, criticising Weigel and Washington Post as Weigel’s photo merely showing the arena before the rally started hours later. He also requested Weigel and Washington Post to apologise and retracted the “fake news”.</p>

              <p>Weigel tweeted to apologise publicly for his mistake, clarifying that it was merely his personal tweet and not a story for Washington Post. But Trump issued second tweet saying that Weigel had admitted he posted a fake photo, adding that
                Weigel should be fired.</p>

              <p>Trump had tweeted seven tweets contain “fake news” during the time frame. One tweet lamented that the “fake news media” did not report on the prosperity of the US economy (10 Dec 1300 UTC), while another one slamming fake news media is “a
                stain on America” (10 Dec 2100 UTC).</p>

              <p>Statistic showed that 98.50% out of the 556,007 users tweeted less than 20 tweets, while two users tweeted more than 400 times within those days.</p>

              <p class="uk-article-lead">In 2015, Twitter added the “quote tweet” feature where it similar to retweet, but it allowed the user to add a comment to a retweet.</p>

              <p>It’s crucial to differentiate quoted tweet and retweet to analyse the sentiment. It is because users who retweet a particular tweet are often being seen as persons who agree with the content and hence retweet to reinforce their stands and
                opinions.
              </p>

              <p>Nevertheless, users who quote a specific tweet may not necessarily agree with the argument of the quote tweet as their opinion and comment can be totally against the argument of the quoted tweet. </p>

              <p>Out of the the total 1,548,140 tweets, 1,159,294 were retweets, 255,704 were original tweets while the remaining 133,142 were quoted tweets.</p>

              <p>The most quoted tweet during the given period was also one of the tweets by Trump. It was the tweet that Trump fired against The New York Times on 11 December at 1400 UTC over a feature story titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/us/politics/donald-trump-president.html?_r=0"

              <h2 class="uk-article-title">Who are the top ten tweeters?</h2>

              <p>The top ten tweeters were a mix of real users and bot. A study of their user profiles, tweet volume, and by examining their activities with online tool <a href="https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/" target="_blank">Botometer</a>, found out
                that six of them were bot while four were genuine users.</p>

              <h3><strong>Bots</strong></h3>

              <p>The bot Twitter users were showing unusual activity trends: They have a massive amount of retweets, promoting the products repeatedly, a significant amount of the same quoted tweet by tagging different users, have an enormous volume of tweets,
                and can tweet within a small interval of time.</p>

              <p>For example, the second top tweeter <a href="https://twitter.com/BudBiddle" target="_blank">@BudBiddle</a> was identified as a bot. The user had tweeted 410 times within the 103 hours. Although most of his tweets were original tweets (253
                tweets), the user kept promoting a housing property, with posts that carried the term “fake news”, by tagging different accounts, even account belongs to Trump.</p>

              <h3><strong>Top tweeter</strong></h3>

              <p>But the top twitter MMAfanzine, with 421 tweets within those days, appears to be a genuine user. A closer look at the account found that it belongs to a <a href="https://mma-insiders.com/" target="_blank">mixed martial arts blog</a> and
                it is managed by a person called Gerry O’Neill.</p>

              <p>The account was created in January 2017, but it already had close to 13,000 tweets, mostly promoting mixed martial arts and the blog. It is believed that the user is using an If This Then That (IFTTT) service to automate the tweets.</p>

              <p>The account has 418 original tweets and three retweets during the period. But the tweets were unrelated to Trump’s tweets. Instead, it was promoting a post titled “Conor McGregor and Donald Trump- Why Fake News won’t Let You Slide” of its
                blog by tagging different users in each tweet.</p>

              <p>A geo-tagged tweet will provide information of at what place the tweet was sent based on coordinates, while “location” can be set by the user. It could be anything besides location, and it is not based on coordinates.</p>

              <p>There were only about one-third of the users enabled geo-tagged and share their “location” respectively. Hence it was hard to track the exact location of most of the users and where the tweets were sent. Some user even set their location
                as “Behind the screen” while most of them just leave it blank.</p>

              <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

              <p>The use of the term “fake news” has been polarised by Trump on Twitter as he alone determined the trend of #fakenews on the social media platform.</p>

              <p>Further research could be done by surveying the perception of the public to determine whether Trump had eroded or polarised their confidence in mainstream media.</p>

              <p>But the more worrying trend would be the massive bots or fake users on Twitter who generate a lot of noise but lack of essential substance for a healthy debate on this subject matter.</p>

              <p>Generating fake retweets and followers had become a business, and such noise could be loud enough to <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-12-07/twitterbots" target="_blank">create political impact</a> as reported by
                the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.</p>

              <p>The trend also raised the concern of lawmakers, especially it involved state players. Last November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16591646/facebook-senate-hearing-feinstein-russia-google-twitter" target="_blank">US Senator Dianne Feinstein</a>                told the lawyer for Twitter and other big tech companies that their social media platforms were being misused.</p>

              <p>She asked those companies to do deal with this matter or else “we will”.</p>

              <p>The study can be further developed by observing how would those companies deal with the political interference on the social media.</p>
