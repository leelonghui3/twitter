# fakenews
A tweets scraper written in Python by using Twitter streaming API

The python script was to track the trend of #fakenews on Twitter from 5pm 9/12/2017 to 12am 14/12/2017 by using the Twitter streaming API.

The script was written so that it could distinguish and scrape truncated original tweets, the full text of retweets and quoted tweets (retweets with usersâ€™ comment), besides other information, for more precise analysis.

The analysis focuses on understanding the peaks of the tweets timeline, popular retweets and quoted tweets, percentage of verified users, identifying bots among top 10 tweeters, sentiments etc.

The analysis was done by using Excel and this is the [link](http://igor.gold.ac.uk/~llee003/fakenews/) to the analysis.

It is one of the coursework of the Digital Sandbox module of the MA Digital Journalism course at Goldsmiths, University of London.
